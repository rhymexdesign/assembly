#Assembly

Welcome to the [Rhyme by Design](http://rhymexdesign.github.io) - Assembly repo! This is where hip hop instrumentals are _designed, tested and built_. It should be an interesting experiment, mostly because we have never seen Github used with the purpose of music composition. 

###Objective

Rhyme By Design will not be possible without some very compelling and dope intstrumentals, mainly because one of the final outcomes will be a 6-track hip hop EP. Our hopes are that **_anyone_** willing or interested in making hip hop tracks, get involved in the process.


###Timeline
By February 2016, we hope to have 12-15 solid tracks to choose from and write to.

##How to Contribute

###Software Prerequistes

Everything we will be building will be on Mac OS Yosemite. Why you ask? Answer, because we're not beatmakers! As time progresses and the project evolves, we are definitely open to learning new ways of making beats. But for now, we're using the following tools:  

- Mac OS Yosemite
- [GarageBand 10.1.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id682658836?mt=12)
- [TX16WX Software Sampler](http://www.tx16wx.com/downloads)
- [Adobe Audition](http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)
- [Final Music Converter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-music-converter/id682180765?mt=12) 


###Github

In order to push (upload) your Garageband projects or wav samples, you will also need to get up and running with Github on your personal machine. Don't be intimidated by this - it's crazy for non-developers or non-designers at first, but once you understand the flow, it's not that bad.
